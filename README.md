# EMDAI

This repository contains a collection of work related to a project at the Uppsala Ambulance Service to develop predictive models for use in Emergency Medical Dispatching. The primary contents of this repository are:

**EMDAI-whitepaper.Rmd** - This R markdown document contains the source code for the latest version of a white paper published as part of the project, which provides a detailed descriptive analysis of two years of data from Uppsala County, and a set of gradient boosting models to predict outcomes within this dataset. A knitted pdf with the same name based on current data is also provided. We will update this document as significant progress is made in the project, and we welcome suggestions for improvements - Feel free to submit an Issue and we'll do our best to address it!

**freetext-explorer.R** - This file contains the source code for a visualization tool used to explore the free text notes written by dispatchers during the dispatch process, and the aggregated data used in this tool is available in _180903_wordratios.rda_
